# Weather API iOS App

In this app, I learned to use API's to grab data on weather. This is also the first app I've made that incorporated multiple screens rather than a single screen interface. 


# What I Learned
- JSON
- Grabbing Data through API
- Delegates, Controllers, and Protocols
- MVC Model
- Segues and animations between screens

I used Swift 4 and Xcode.
